# tv-script-generation
TV Script(Sienfield season 9) using LSTM

Generate TV Scripts
Introduction
In this project, you'll generate your own Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs. You'll be using a Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons. The Neural Network you'll build will generate a new, "fake" TV script.

Getting the project files
The project files can be found in our public GitHub repo, in the project-tv-script-generation folder. You can download the files from there, but it's better to clone the repository to your computer using:

git clone https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch.git
This way you can stay up to date with any changes we make by pulling the changes to your local repository with git pull.

You may also choose to complete your project using the provided, in-classroom project notebook; this will just require that you run the project notebook, and download the complete files, as specified below.

Submission
Ensure you've passed all the unit tests in the notebook.
Ensure you pass all points on the rubric.
When you're done with the project, please save the notebook as both an .ipynb file and as an HTML file. You can do this by going to the File menu in the notebook and choosing "Download as" > HTML. Ensure you submit both the Jupyter Notebook and it's HTML version together.
Package the "dlnd_tv_script_generation.ipynb", "helper.py", "problem_unittests.py", and the HTML file into a zip archive, or push the files from your GitHub repo.
